            <h2>What are stats</h2>
            <p>
                RPG stats in video games are numerical values that define a character's abilities and performance within the game world. These stats can include attributes like Health, Strength, Agility, and Magic, each influencing different gameplay mechanics. For example, a character with high Agility may move faster and dodge attacks more effectively, while one with high Health can endure more damage. Players often earn experience points to level up, enhancing these stats and unlocking new skills or abilities. The balance and distribution of these stats are crucial for crafting a character that suits a player's preferred playstyle, whether that involves brute force, strategic planning, or stealthy tactics, ultimately shaping the overall gaming experience.

            <h3>Are bigger stats better stats?</h3>
            <p>
                When deciding on stat maximums in an RPG, choosing low or high values has its pros and cons. Low maximums, like a cap of 30, can make gameplay simpler and more balanced. They encourage players to focus on specific strengths, making each point feel important. This can lead to more thoughtful character choices, but it might also make players feel less powerful as they progress. On the other hand, high maximums, such as caps of 1000, can give players a sense of epic growth and power, making the game feel more exciting. However, they can also lead to some characters becoming way stronger than others, which might make the game less fair. Ultimately, the choice should match the game's overall feel and how you want players to experience character development.

            <h4>Let us compare</h4>
            <p>
                In a game like Baldur’s Gate, characters start with relatively low stats. The lowest stat can be as low as 8, while your highest specialized stat usually sits between 16 and 17 at level 1. A secondary stat might be around 15 to 16, and your health (HP) is typically around 14 to 15. The rest of your stats often range from 8 to 10. In contrast, in World of Warcraft, your highest stat can start at 20, with secondary stats between 17 and 20. Your stamina, which is equivalent to HP, usually falls between 15 and 17, while other stats range from 10 to 15. While WoW features larger stat values overall, the real difference becomes apparent at endgame. In Baldur’s Gate, maximum stats typically cap out around 20 to 22, whereas in World of Warcraft, they can exceed 1000. This stark difference makes Baldur’s Gate feel like every stat point is crucial, while the higher values in WoW create a sense of continuous growth and power.
